### Navigation Bar Kata

A company desires to have an easy way to manage roles and sharing permissions.

- The highest unit of the hierarchy is an organization. An Organization must have an id and a name 
- An Organization can be an Owner or a Partner
- An Organization can have 0 to 100 accounts. An account must have an id and a name.
- An Organization can have 0 to 10000 users. A user must have an id and a name.
- An Organization can give permissions to users in another account to manage resources via an account.

An Organization A can give permission to Organization B and Organization C. We therefore call Organization B and Organization C
partners of Organization A. An Organization B can give permission to Organization A which means Organization A is a partner of Organization B
- When a user is created they belong to an account, and they are staff of that organization.
